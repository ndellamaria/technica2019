## Project Name
FemmeCare

## Elevator Pitch

FemmeCare is a finance app that rounds off all banking purchases to the nearest dollar and uses that to donate or invest in nonprofits that support women. From providing menstrual products to the homeless, destigmatizing sex workers, making industries more inclusive and diverse, securing protection from revenge porn, to advocating for the trans community, the user chooses where their money goes, but all options are female-centric and all-inclusive of females.

## It's Built With:

Flask (Python framework), SQLite, Capital One API, Adobe XD

## Here's the whole story (Be sure to write what inspired you, what you learned, how you built, and challenges you faced):

Developed user interface for mobile application with Adobe XD and built a web application with Flask based on the mock-ups. The web-based app will stimulate a purchase and will provide a user with a group of organizations to choose from. A user can assign one organization per banking account, and is able to view the total amount they’ve donated to their chosen organizations.

Stimulating a payment was one of the challenges faced when building the website app, along with setting up the database.
